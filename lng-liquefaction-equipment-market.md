<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Liquefaction Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Exchanger</li><li>Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The LNG liquefaction equipment market includes various types of equipment such as heat exchangers and compressors. Heat exchangers are devices that transfer heat between two fluids, enabling the liquefaction process by cooling down natural gas. Compressors, on the other hand, compress the natural gas to increase its pressure, making it easier to liquefy. Both heat exchangers and compressors play crucial roles in the liquefaction process of LNG, helping to convert natural gas into a liquid state for transportation and storage.</p></p>
