<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mid-end ICU ventilators refer to the respiratory devices used to assist patients with breathing difficulties in the intensive care unit. They can be categorized into two types: invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves inserting a tube into the patient's airway, providing controlled oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, delivers respiratory support through a mask or nasal interface without the need for intubation. Both types aim to improve oxygenation and ventilation in critically ill patients, but they differ in the method of application.</p></p>
