<p><ul><li>PD1 Inhibitors</li><li>PDL1 Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PD1 inhibitors and PDL1 inhibitors are types of drugs used in cancer treatment. PD1 inhibitors work by blocking a protein called PD1 on immune cells, thereby enabling these cells to attack cancer cells. On the other hand, PDL1 inhibitors target the protein PDL1 found on cancer cells, preventing it from interacting with PD1 and inhibiting immune response. Both types of inhibitors help to enhance the body's immune system to fight against cancer cells. These inhibitors have shown promise in treating various types of cancers and are being actively researched and developed.</p></p>
