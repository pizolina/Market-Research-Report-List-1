<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrocautery Cautery Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electrocautery cautery machines are used in surgical procedures to control bleeding or seal tissue. These machines come in two types: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar cautery machines use a single active electrode that is placed on the tissue, while the patient's body serves as the return electrode. On the other hand, bipolar cautery machines use two active electrodes to complete the electrical circuit within the tissue itself, reducing the risk of unintended damage to surrounding areas. Both types provide precise and efficient tissue coagulation and are widely used in various medical settings.</p></p>
