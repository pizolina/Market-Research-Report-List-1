<p><strong>The Anti-graffiti Coatings and Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Permanent</li><li>Permanent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-graffiti coatings and films are used to protect surfaces from graffiti vandalism. Non-permanent coatings are temporary solutions that can be easily cleaned or removed without damaging the surface. They are typically sacrificial coatings that are re-applied after graffiti removal. Permanent coatings, on the other hand, provide long-term protection by creating a barrier that prevents graffiti from adhering to the surface. These coatings may require specialized cleaning methods but offer a more durable solution. Both types of coatings play a crucial role in deterring and mitigating graffiti vandalism.</p></p>
