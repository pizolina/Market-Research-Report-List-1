<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Graft Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autografts</li><li>Allografts</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bone graft substitute market includes autografts and allografts. Autografts are bone grafts taken from the same individual, typically from the hip or ribs. They are considered the gold standard due to the bone's ability to heal naturally. However, autografts can cause additional pain and discomfort. Allografts, on the other hand, are bone grafts taken from a deceased donor or cadaver. They are available in various forms, such as demineralized bone matrix or freeze-dried bone, and are commonly used as an alternative when autografts are not feasible or desirable.</p></p>
