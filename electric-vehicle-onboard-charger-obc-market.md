<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Onboard Charger (OBC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Charger</li><li>AC Charger</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electric Vehicle Onboard Charger (OBC) market consists of two types: DC Charger and AC Charger. A DC Charger allows the direct conversion of AC power from the grid into high-voltage DC power, which is used to charge the vehicle's battery. This type is commonly used for high-speed charging stations. On the other hand, an AC Charger converts AC power into low-voltage DC power, which is then sent to the vehicle's OBC to charge the battery. AC Chargers are usually used in residential or commercial charging applications that require a lower charging rate.</p></p>
