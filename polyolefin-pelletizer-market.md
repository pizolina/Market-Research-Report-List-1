<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyolefin Pelletizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gear Pump Pelletizer</li><li>Extrusion Pelletizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyolefin pelletizers are used for processing polyolefin materials into small pellets for various applications. Two common types of polyolefin pelletizers are gear pump pelletizers and extrusion pelletizers.</p><p>Gear pump pelletizers use a gear pump to transport the molten polyolefin through a die plate, where it is cut into pellets by rotating blades. This method offers high precision and control over pellet size and shape.</p><p>Extrusion pelletizers, on the other hand, involve pushing the molten polyolefin through an extrusion die, which forms it into continuous strands. These strands are then cut into pellets using rotating knives. Extrusion pelletizers are often cost-effective and suitable for high-volume production.</p></p>
