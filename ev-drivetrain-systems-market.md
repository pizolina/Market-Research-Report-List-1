<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EV Drivetrain Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Battery Electric</li><li>Hybrid Electric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EV Drivetrain Systems market is divided into two types: Battery Electric and Hybrid Electric. Battery Electric vehicles rely solely on electric power, using a rechargeable battery pack as their primary source of energy. They do not have an internal combustion engine and produce zero tailpipe emissions. Hybrid Electric vehicles, on the other hand, combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and battery pack. This allows them to operate on both electricity and gasoline, providing increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions compared to conventional vehicles.</p></p>
