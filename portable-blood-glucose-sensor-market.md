<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Blood Glucose Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Minimally Invasive</li><li>Non Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable blood glucose sensor market can be divided into two main types: minimally invasive and non-invasive. Minimally invasive sensors require a small prick on the skin to draw a blood sample for glucose analysis. These sensors are commonly used in traditional blood glucose meters. On the other hand, non-invasive sensors do not require a blood sample and instead use alternative methods such as light or electrical signals to measure glucose levels. These sensors are usually wearable devices or continuous glucose monitors that provide real-time readings without the need for blood sampling.</p></p>
