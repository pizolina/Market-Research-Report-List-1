<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Night Vision Imaging Scope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging</li><li>Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Thermal Night Vision Imaging Scope market is divided into two types: Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging and Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging. Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging uses microbolometers to detect and convert infrared radiation into electrical signals. It is more affordable and portable but offers lower resolution images. On the other hand, Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging uses superconductors or cooled detectors to enhance image quality and provide higher resolution images. However, it is more expensive and requires cryogenic cooling to function effectively.</p></p>
