<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Water Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled Water Chillers</li><li>Water-cooled Water Chillers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Water Chillers Market consists of two primary types: Air-cooled Water Chillers and Water-cooled Water Chillers. Air-cooled Water Chillers are designed to remove heat from the water using air as the cooling medium. These chillers are typically more cost-effective and easier to install, as they do not require a separate water source for cooling. On the other hand, Water-cooled Water Chillers use water as the cooling medium and are suited for larger cooling applications. They provide superior cooling efficiency but require a dedicated water source for operation.</p></p>
