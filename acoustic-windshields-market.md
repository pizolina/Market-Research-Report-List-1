<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acoustic Windshields Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Acoustic Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acoustic windshields come in two main types: laminated glass and acoustic glass. Laminated glass windshields consist of two layers of glass with a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) sandwiched in between. This PVB layer acts as a noise-dampening barrier, reducing the transmission of sound into the vehicle cabin. On the other hand, acoustic glass windshields are manufactured using a special type of glass that has sound-absorbing properties. This glass reduces noise levels by absorbing sound waves, resulting in a quieter driving experience.</p></p>
