<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Apomorphine Delivery Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pen Injectors</li><li>Infusion Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Apomorphine delivery devices refer to the tools or systems used for administering apomorphine, a medication commonly prescribed for Parkinson's disease. The market for these devices can be categorized into two main types: pen injectors and infusion pumps. Pen injectors are handheld devices resembling pens that allow patients to self-administer apomorphine subcutaneously (under the skin). Infusion pumps, on the other hand, are devices that continuously deliver apomorphine via a small tube inserted under the skin and connected to a pump. Both types of devices offer convenient and effective methods for delivering apomorphine to patients.</p></p>
