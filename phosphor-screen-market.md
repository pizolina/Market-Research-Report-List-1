<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phosphor Screen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short Decay</li><li>Long Decay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The phosphor screen market can be divided into two types: short decay and long decay. Short decay phosphor screens emit light for a brief period after exposure to a radiation source before it rapidly fades away. This type is preferred for high-speed applications where a clear image is needed. On the other hand, long decay phosphor screens emit light that persists for an extended period after exposure, making them suitable for applications that require prolonged image retention, such as medical imaging or security systems.</p></p>
