<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Frame for Solar Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screw Frame</li><li>Angle Code Frame</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aluminum frame market for solar panels is divided into two main types: screw frame and angle code frame. In screw frame systems, the frame is assembled using screws and brackets, providing a strong and stable structure for the solar panel. On the other hand, angle code frame systems use angle-shaped aluminum profiles that are connected together to form the frame. This type of frame offers ease of installation and adjustability to accommodate various mounting angles. Both frame types are commonly used in the solar industry, providing secure and durable support for solar panels.</p></p>
