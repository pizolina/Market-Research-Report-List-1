<p><strong>The Peritoneal Dialysis Solutions Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CAPD</li><li>APD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Peritoneal dialysis solutions are used in two types of peritoneal dialysis treatments called continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). CAPD involves manually exchanging dialysis solution several times a day, while APD utilizes a machine to perform the exchanges automatically during the night. Both treatments aim to remove waste and excess fluids from the body in patients with kidney failure. The peritoneal dialysis solutions market refers to the industry that provides these specialized solutions to medical facilities and patients.</p></p>
