<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Hybrid Transmission Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Series Type Hybrid Transmission System</li><li>Parallel Type Hybrid Transmission System</li><li>Mixed Type Hybrid Transmission System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive hybrid transmission systems refer to the mechanisms used in hybrid vehicles to transfer power from the engine to the wheels. There are three types of hybrid transmission systems: series type, parallel type, and mixed type. In a series type system, the engine solely charges the battery, which then powers an electric motor that drives the wheels. In a parallel type system, both the engine and electric motor can independently power the vehicle. Mixed type systems combine features of both series and parallel systems, allowing for more flexibility in power distribution.</p></p>
