<p><strong>The Agricultural Biostimulants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil</li><li>Foliar</li><li>Seed</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural biostimulants are substances or microorganisms that enhance plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance. These biostimulants can be applied to the soil, leaves (foliar), seeds, or through other application methods. When applied to the soil, biostimulants improve the physical structure, nutrient retention, and microbial activity, leading to better plant root development and nutrient absorption. Foliar application involves spraying biostimulants directly onto plant leaves, promoting nutrient absorption and boosting plant resilience. Seed treatment with biostimulants enhances germination, root development, and early crop establishment. Other application methods may include drip irrigation or hydroponics for specific agricultural needs.</p></p>
