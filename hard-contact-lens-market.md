<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Contact Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas Permeable Lenses</li><li>Hybrid Contact Lenses</li><li>PMMA Lenses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hard contact lens market comprises three main types: gas permeable lenses, hybrid contact lenses, and PMMA lenses. Gas permeable lenses are made of rigid materials that allow oxygen to pass through, providing comfort and reducing the risk of eye irritation. Hybrid contact lenses combine a rigid center and a soft outer ring to provide clear vision and comfort for those with special eye conditions. PMMA lenses are rigid and made from a material called polymethyl methacrylate, providing excellent visual acuity but limited oxygen transmission.</p></p>
