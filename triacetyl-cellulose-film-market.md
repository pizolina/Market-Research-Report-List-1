<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Triacetyl Cellulose Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>40μm</li><li>80μm</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Triacetyl Cellulose (TAC) Film is available in two types: 40μm and 80μm. These measurements refer to the thickness of the film. The 40μm TAC Film is thinner and more flexible, making it suitable for applications that require high transparency, such as protective films for electronic devices. On the other hand, the 80μm TAC Film is thicker and more rigid, making it ideal for applications like the manufacture of polarized sunglasses, where durability and robustness are crucial. Both types of TAC Film cater to different industries and purposes based on their respective thicknesses.</p></p>
