<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler Pipes Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Pipe Systems</li><li>Dry Pipe Systems</li><li>Deluge Systems</li><li>Pre-Action Systems</li><li>Foam Water Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Water Spray Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fire sprinkler pipes market caters to various applications such as wet pipe systems, dry pipe systems, deluge systems, pre-action systems, foam water sprinkler systems, and water spray systems. Wet pipe systems use pipes filled with water at all times, ready to spray when a fire is detected. Dry pipe systems, on the other hand, are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, and water is released once a fire triggers the system. Deluge systems release a large volume of water when a fire is detected, while pre-action systems combine elements of dry and wet pipe systems. Foam water sprinkler systems use a mixture of foam concentrate and water, while water spray systems are used for special applications requiring a precise water spray pattern.</p></p>
