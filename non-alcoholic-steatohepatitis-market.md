<p><h1>Insights into Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Market Size: Analysing Market Share, Trends, and Growth from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a disease characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, leading to inflammation and liver damage. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, NASH occurs in individuals who do not consume excessive alcohol. NASH can progress to more severe conditions, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, making it a significant public health concern worldwide.</p><p>The current outlook for the NASH market is promising, with a projected growth rate of 12.5% during the forecasted period. Several factors contribute to this positive outlook. Firstly, the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes, which are closely associated with NASH, is driving the demand for therapeutic interventions. Additionally, increased awareness and diagnosis of NASH have led to a greater demand for effective treatments.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry is actively investing in the development of novel therapies for NASH, given the lucrative market potential. Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs for NASH, leaving a significant unmet need. However, numerous experimental drugs are in the pipeline, with some showing promising results in clinical trials. These potential treatments aim to target the underlying mechanisms of NASH, including inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunction.</p><p>While the future of the NASH market holds promise, challenges remain. The complex nature of NASH and the lack of reliable non-invasive diagnostic tests make clinical trials and drug development challenging. Additionally, the high cost of treatment and reimbursement issues may limit patient access to emerging therapies. However, advancements in diagnostic technologies and increased collaboration among stakeholders, including academia, industry, and regulatory authorities, are expected to address these challenges and propel the growth of the NASH market in the coming years.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral</li><li>Parenteral</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) market has two main routes of treatment: oral and parenteral. Oral medications are taken by mouth and are convenient for patients as they can be self-administered at home. Parenteral medications are administered via injection or infusion and are commonly used for more severe cases or when oral options are not effective. Both routes aim to address the underlying liver inflammation and fibrosis associated with NASH. Developing effective treatments through these applications is crucial to meeting the growing demand for NASH therapies.</p></p>

<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>AstraZeneca is a multinational pharmaceutical company involved in the research, development, and manufacturing of prescription medicines across a range of therapeutic areas. While the company has a diverse portfolio, it has been actively working on the development of treatments for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a liver disease commonly associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. AstraZeneca has been involved in clinical trials for several compounds targeting NASH, including lanifibranor and AZD2693. The company aims to leverage its expertise and resources to address the unmet medical needs in this area.</p><p>Another key player in the NASH market is Gilead Sciences. Gilead has a strong presence in the field of liver diseases and has been actively working to develop therapeutics for NASH. The company's leading candidate is selonsertib (GS-4997), an investigational, oral small molecule inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Selonsertib has shown promising results in Phase 2 clinical trials and is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 trials.</p><p>Intercept Pharmaceuticals is another significant player in the NASH market. The company's lead product, obeticholic acid (OCA), has received accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), another liver disease. Intercept is now conducting Phase 3 clinical trials for OCA in NASH patients and is expected to be a major player in the NASH space.</p><p>In terms of market growth, the NASH market is expected to witness substantial growth in the coming years as the prevalence of obesity and related metabolic disorders continues to rise. According to a report by Global Market Insights, the global NASH market is estimated to exceed $25 billion by 2026, with North America expected to hold a significant share.</p><p>The sales revenue of the listed companies can vary greatly. However, as of recent data, Gilead Sciences reported NASH-related sales revenue of around $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2021. AstraZeneca's revenue for NASH-related products is not readily available, as its pipeline is still in the clinical development stage. Intercept Pharmaceuticals reported net sales of OCA amounting to $346 million for the first quarter of 2021. It is important to note that these figures can be subject to change with market dynamics and product launches.</p></p>
