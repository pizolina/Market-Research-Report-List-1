<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Cordierite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Porous Cordierite</li><li>Porous Cordierite</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cordierite is a mineral widely used in various industries. The Synthetic Cordierite market can be classified into two types: Non-Porous Cordierite and Porous Cordierite. Non-Porous Cordierite refers to cordierite materials with a dense structure, making them highly resistant to thermal shock and chemical corrosion. These qualities make Non-Porous Cordierite ideal for applications where high strength and durability are required. On the other hand, Porous Cordierite has a more open structure, allowing for better heat and gas diffusion. Thus, Porous Cordierite is commonly used in applications that involve filtration or catalysis processes.</p></p>
