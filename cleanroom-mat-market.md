<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cleanroom Mat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temporary Tacky Mats</li><li>Permanent Tacky Mats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cleanroom mats are essential in maintaining a sterile environment, primarily in industries like pharmaceuticals and electronics. There are two types of cleanroom mats: temporary tacky mats and permanent tacky mats. Temporary tacky mats are disposable and easily replaceable sticky mats that capture contaminants from shoe soles and other sources. Permanent tacky mats, on the other hand, consist of multiple peel-away sticky layers that can be replaced individually, making them more cost-effective in the long run. Both types of mats help minimize the entry of dust, dirt, and other particles into cleanrooms to ensure product safety and integrity.</p></p>
