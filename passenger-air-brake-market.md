<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Air Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc Brake</li><li>Air Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Passenger Air Brake market consists of two types: Air Disc Brake and Air Drum Brake. Air Disc Brakes use a caliper to clamp down on a rotor, providing enhanced braking performance and heat dissipation. They are often preferred in high-performance vehicles due to their ability to reduce stopping distances. On the other hand, Air Drum Brakes use brake shoes and a rotating drum to generate friction and slow down the vehicle, making them a more common choice for commercial vehicles. Both types are critical components in ensuring safe and reliable braking in passenger vehicles.</p></p>
