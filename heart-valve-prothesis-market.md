<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Prothesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve prosthesis market consists of three main types of valves: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive devices that are inserted through a catheter, without the need for open-heart surgery. Tissue heart valves are made from animal tissues, such as pig or cow, and are used to replace damaged or diseased human valves. Mechanical heart valves, on the other hand, are made from artificial materials and are designed to last longer but require lifelong blood thinners.</p></p>
