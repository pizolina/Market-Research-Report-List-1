<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propylene Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chlorohydrin Process</li><li>SM/PO</li><li>HPPO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propylene oxide (PO) is produced through different processes, including the Chlorohydrin Process, SM/PO, and HPPO market. In the Chlorohydrin Process, propylene reacts with chlorine to form propylene chlorohydrin, which is then converted to PO. The SM/PO method involves direct oxidation of propylene using air or oxygen, resulting in PO production. The HPPO market utilizes hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in combination with a catalyst, enabling the direct synthesis of PO from propylene. These processes play a significant role in the production and supply of propylene oxide in the market.</p></p>
