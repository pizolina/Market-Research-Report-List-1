<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation System in Commercial Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic EGR Valve</li><li>Electric EGR Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system is widely used in commercial vehicles to reduce emissions and improve engine performance. There are two types of EGR valves available in the market: Pneumatic EGR Valve and Electric EGR Valve. </p><p>A pneumatic EGR valve operates using pressurized air to control the re-circulation of exhaust gases into the engine's intake manifold. It helps regulate the amount of recirculated gases based on engine load and operating conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, an electric EGR valve uses an electric motor to control the flow of exhaust gases. It offers more precise control and responsiveness, as it can adjust the gas flow more accurately based on engine parameters.</p><p>Both types of EGR valves serve the same purpose of reducing emissions by diverting a portion of the exhaust gases back into the engine. However, the choice between pneumatic and electric EGR valves depends on factors like cost, engine design, and performance requirements.</p></p>
