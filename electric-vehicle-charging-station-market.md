<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Charging Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Level 2</li><li>Level 3</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle charging station market consists of two main types: Level 2 and Level 3. Level 2 charging stations provide alternating current (AC) power and can charge a vehicle significantly faster than a standard household outlet. They are suitable for overnight or longer charging periods. On the other hand, Level 3 charging stations, also known as DC fast chargers, provide direct current (DC) power, allowing vehicles to recharge in a much shorter time, typically within 30 minutes. Level 3 chargers are commonly found in public areas like shopping centers or along highways for quick on-the-go charging.</p></p>
