<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PHEV</li><li>BEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric car market can be divided into two main types: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). PHEVs are vehicles that have both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, allowing them to run on both gasoline and electricity. BEVs, on the other hand, are fully electric vehicles that run solely on electricity and require recharging from an external power source. While PHEVs offer a hybrid driving experience, BEVs are entirely emission-free, relying solely on electric power.</p></p>
